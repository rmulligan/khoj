# Shareable Chat

You can share any of your conversations by going to the three dot menu on the conversation and selecting 'Share'. This will create a **public** link that you can share with anyone. The link will open the conversation in the same state it was when you shared it, so your future messages will not be visible to the person you shared it with.

This means you can easily share a conversation with someone to show them how you solved a problem, or to get help with something you're working on.
